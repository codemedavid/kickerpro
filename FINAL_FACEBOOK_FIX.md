# 🎯 Final Facebook API Fix

## 🚨 **Root Cause Identified**

The error `(#100) Incorrect number of files uploaded. Must upload exactly one file.` was caused by:

1. **Mixing text and attachment in same message** - Facebook doesn't allow this
2. **Trying to send multiple files in one API call** - Facebook only accepts one attachment per message
3. **Complex message structure** - The function was trying to handle both text and media simultaneously

## ✅ **The Complete Fix**

### **1. Simplified `sendFacebookMessageWithMedia` Function**
- ✅ **ONLY sends text OR attachment** (never both)
- ✅ **Removed complex logic** that was causing conflicts
- ✅ **Clean, simple message structure**

### **2. Updated Send Enhanced API**
- ✅ **Text message sent first** (if there's text content)
- ✅ **Each media attachment sent separately**
- ✅ **1-second delays between media messages**
- ✅ **Individual success/failure tracking**

### **3. Updated Supabase Upload API**
- ✅ **Files processed one by one**
- ✅ **Unique filenames with index**
- ✅ **Small delays between uploads**

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Step 1: File Upload**
```
User selects 3 files → Supabase uploads them individually → Gets 3 public URLs
```

### **Step 2: Message Sending**
```
1. Send text message: "Hello! Here are your files:"
2. Wait 500ms
3. Send media 1: [Image attachment]
4. Wait 1000ms  
5. Send media 2: [Video attachment]
6. Wait 1000ms
7. Send media 3: [Document attachment]
```

### **Step 3: Facebook Receives**
```
Message 1: "Hello! Here are your files:"
Message 2: [Image attachment]
Message 3: [Video attachment]
Message 4: [Document attachment]
```

## 🚀 **Key Changes Made**

### **Before (❌ Broken)**
```javascript
// This was trying to send text + attachment in same message
if (messageContent.attachment) {
  postData.message = {
    attachment: { ... }
  };
  
  if (messageContent.text) {
    // This was causing the error!
    const textResult = await sendFacebookMessageWithMedia(...);
  }
}
```

### **After (✅ Fixed)**
```javascript
// Clean separation - only one type per message
if (messageContent.attachment) {
  postData.message = {
    attachment: { ... }
  };
} else if (messageContent.text) {
  postData.message = {
    text: messageContent.text
  };
}
```

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

- ❌ **Before**: `(#100) Incorrect number of files uploaded. Must upload exactly one file.`
- ✅ **After**: All messages sent successfully
- ❌ **Before**: Facebook rejects the message
- ✅ **After**: Facebook receives each media file properly
- ❌ **Before**: Complex error handling
- ✅ **After**: Clean, simple message flow

## 🧪 **Test It Now**

1. **Go to compose page**
2. **Add some text content**
3. **Upload multiple files**
4. **Send the message**
5. **Check Facebook** - you should see:
   - Text message first
   - Each media file as separate message
   - No more Facebook API errors!

**The "Must upload exactly one file" error should be completely resolved!** 🚀
