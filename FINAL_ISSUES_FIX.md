# üîß Final Issues Fix - Two Problems Identified

## üö® **Issues Found in Logs**

### **Issue 1: Supabase Storage RLS Policy Error**
```
"error": "new row violates row-level security policy"
```
- File upload to Supabase Storage is being blocked by RLS policies
- The policies are too restrictive for authenticated users

### **Issue 2: Facebook Access Token Expired**
```
"Error validating access token: Session has expired on Friday, 24-Oct-25 12:00:00 PDT"
```
- Facebook access token has expired
- Need to refresh the token

## ‚úÖ **Fix 1: Supabase Storage RLS Policy**

### **Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own media files" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own media files" ON storage.objects;

-- Create more permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload media files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'media' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to media files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete media files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'media' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update media files" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'media' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

## ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Facebook Access Token**

### **Option A: Refresh Token in Facebook Dashboard**
1. Go to your Facebook App Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Messenger** ‚Üí **Settings**
3. Click **"Regenerate Page Access Token"**
4. Copy the new token
5. Update your database

### **Option B: Update Database Directly**
```sql
UPDATE facebook_pages 
SET access_token = 'YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'
WHERE id = 'f0c5eb14-0106-4eac-8bd9-9b0a84e5aedc';
```

## üéØ **What This Fixes**

### **Before (‚ùå Broken)**
- File uploads fail with RLS policy error
- Facebook API calls fail with expired token
- Media attachments have empty URLs
- Messages can't be sent

### **After (‚úÖ Working)**
- File uploads work to Supabase Storage
- Facebook API calls work with fresh token
- Media attachments have real URLs
- Messages send successfully

## üöÄ **Test After Fixes**

1. **Run the SQL fixes above**
2. **Refresh your Facebook access token**
3. **Try uploading a file again**
4. **Send a test message**
5. **Check Facebook - should receive media!**

## üéâ **Expected Results**

- ‚úÖ **File uploads**: WORKING (no more RLS errors)
- ‚úÖ **Facebook API**: WORKING (fresh token)
- ‚úÖ **Media URLs**: REAL Supabase URLs
- ‚úÖ **Message sending**: SUCCESS

**Both issues will be resolved and your media system will work perfectly!** üöÄ
