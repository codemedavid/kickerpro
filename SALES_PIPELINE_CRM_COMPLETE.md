## 🎯 Advanced Features (Implemented)

### **1. Weighted Pipeline Value**

```javascript
// Not just sum of all values
// Weighted by probability:

Opportunity 1: $10,000 × 50% = $5,000
Opportunity 2: $8,000 × 75% = $6,000
Opportunity 3: $5,000 × 90% = $4,500

Weighted Total: $15,500
(More realistic than raw $23,000)
```

### **2. Stage Movement**

```javascript
// Move forward/backward:
Current: "Contacted" (stage_order: 2)
Click "Next →": Moves to "Qualified" (stage_order: 3)
Click "← Back": Moves to "New Lead" (stage_order: 1)

// Auto-logs activity:
"Stage changed from Contacted to Qualified"
```

### **3. Auto-Create Stages**

```javascript
// First time visiting pipeline:
IF no stages exist:
  Create default 7 stages automatically
