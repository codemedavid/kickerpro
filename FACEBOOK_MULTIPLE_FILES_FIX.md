# 🔧 Fixed Facebook Multiple Files Error

## 🚨 **The Problem**

Facebook API error:
```
(#100) Incorrect number of files uploaded. Must upload exactly one file.
```

This happens because Facebook's Send API can only handle **one media attachment per message**.

## ✅ **The Solution**

I've updated the system to handle multiple files properly:

### **1. Supabase Upload API** (`/api/upload-supabase`)
- ✅ **Processes files one by one** (not all at once)
- ✅ **Adds unique filenames** with index to avoid conflicts
- ✅ **Includes small delays** between uploads to avoid rate limiting
- ✅ **Better error handling** for individual files

### **2. Send Enhanced API** (`/api/messages/[id]/send-enhanced`)
- ✅ **Sends text message first** (if there's text content)
- ✅ **Sends each media attachment as a separate message**
- ✅ **Adds delays between media messages** (1 second) to avoid rate limiting
- ✅ **Tracks success/failure for each media item**

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Step 1: File Upload**
```
User selects 3 files → Supabase uploads them one by one → Gets 3 public URLs
```

### **Step 2: Message Sending**
```
Text message → Media 1 → (1s delay) → Media 2 → (1s delay) → Media 3
```

### **Step 3: Facebook Receives**
```
Message 1: "Hello! Here's your content"
Message 2: [Image attachment]
Message 3: [Video attachment] 
Message 4: [Document attachment]
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

- ❌ **Before**: Facebook rejected multiple files in one message
- ✅ **After**: Each file sent as separate message (Facebook approved)
- ❌ **Before**: Rate limiting issues with bulk uploads
- ✅ **After**: Controlled delays prevent rate limiting
- ❌ **Before**: All-or-nothing file handling
- ✅ **After**: Individual file success/failure tracking

## 🎉 **Ready to Test!**

1. **Upload multiple files** in the compose page
2. **Send the message** 
3. **Check Facebook** - you should see:
   - Text message first
   - Each media file as a separate message
   - No more "Must upload exactly one file" errors

**Facebook will now receive your media properly!** 🚀
