# ✅ Facebook Page Connection - FIXED!

## 🎉 The Issue is Solved!

### ❌ Problem:
```
Error: An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.
```

### ✅ Solution:
Changed from **client-side** Facebook SDK to **server-side** API calls!

---

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### Before (Client-Side - Didn't Work):
```javascript
// Client tries to call Facebook API directly
window.FB.api('/me/accounts', ...) 
// ❌ No access token available on client
```

### After (Server-Side - Works!):
```javascript
// Client calls our API
fetch('/api/facebook/pages')
  ↓
// Server has access token from login cookie
// Server calls Facebook Graph API with token
// Server returns pages to client
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Complete Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Connect Page" button
   ↓
2. Frontend calls: GET /api/facebook/pages
   ↓
3. Server gets access token from secure cookie
   ↓
4. Server calls Facebook Graph API:
   GET https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/me/accounts
   with the user's access token
   ↓
5. Facebook returns user's pages
   ↓
6. Server returns pages to frontend
   ↓
7. Dialog shows all available pages
   ↓
8. User selects pages and clicks "Connect"
   ↓
9. Frontend calls: POST /api/pages
   ↓
10. Server saves pages to Supabase
   ↓
11. Success! Pages are connected
```

## 🎯 Files Changed

### 1. Created: `/src/app/api/facebook/pages/route.ts`
**Purpose:** Server-side Facebook Graph API integration

**What it does:**
- Gets access token from secure HTTP-only cookie
- Calls Facebook Graph API: `/me/accounts`
- Returns pages with all details
- Handles errors properly

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/facebook/pages
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "123456789",
      "name": "My Business Page",
      "category": "Local Business",
      "access_token": "EAAxx...",
      "picture": {"data": {"url": "..."}},
      "fan_count": 1250
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### 2. Updated: `/src/app/api/auth/facebook/route.ts`
**What changed:**
- Now stores Facebook access token in secure cookie
- Token used for subsequent API calls
- Available for fetching pages, sending messages, etc.

**Cookies set:**
```javascript
fb-auth-user: userId          // Who's logged in
fb-access-token: accessToken  // For Facebook API calls
```

### 3. Updated: `/src/app/dashboard/pages/page.tsx`
**What changed:**
- Removed client-side Facebook SDK dependency
- Now calls `/api/facebook/pages` instead
- Cleaner, more reliable code
- Better error handling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated with Facebook"

**Cause:** Access token cookie missing or expired

**Fix:**
1. Logout and login again
2. This will refresh your access token
3. Try connecting pages again

### "Failed to fetch pages from Facebook"

**Check Server Logs:**
```
[Facebook Pages API] Facebook API error: {...}
```

**Common Causes:**
- Access token expired → Re-login
- Permissions not granted → Login again with all permissions
- Facebook API down → Try again later

### No Pages in Dialog

**Possible Reasons:**
1. You don't have any Facebook pages
2. You're not an admin of any pages
3. Permissions not granted during login

**Fix:**
- Create a Facebook page: [facebook.com/pages/create](https://facebook.com/pages/create)
- Make sure you're the admin
- Login again and grant all permissions
