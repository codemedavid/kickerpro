# 📘 Facebook Pages Connection - Complete Guide

## ✅ What I Just Implemented

I've completely built the Facebook page connection feature! Here's what now works:

### New Features:

1. **✅ Facebook SDK Integration**
   - Fetches your Facebook pages via Graph API
   - Gets page details (name, category, followers, access tokens)
   - Handles permissions properly

2. **✅ Page Selection Dialog**
   - Shows all pages you have admin access to
   - Multi-select with checkboxes
   - Shows already connected pages
   - Beautiful modal interface

3. **✅ API Route (`/api/pages`)**
   - Saves pages to Supabase database
   - Updates existing pages if reconnecting
   - Stores page access tokens for messaging
   - Proper error handling

4. **✅ Database Integration**
   - Saves to `facebook_pages` table
   - Tracks follower count, profile pictures
   - Links pages to your user account

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Step-by-Step Flow:

```
1. Click "Connect Page" button
   ↓
2. Facebook SDK fetches your pages via /me/accounts API
   ↓
3. Dialog shows all your Facebook pages
   ↓
4. Select pages you want to connect (checkboxes)
   ↓
5. Click "Connect X Pages" button
   ↓
6. Pages saved to Supabase database
   ↓
7. Success! Pages appear in your list
```

### What Gets Saved:

For each Facebook page:
- **Page ID** - Unique Facebook identifier
- **Name** - Page name
- **Category** - Business category
- **Profile Picture** - Page avatar URL
- **Follower Count** - Number of followers
- **Access Token** - For sending messages (encrypted)
- **Status** - Active/inactive

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Make Sure You're Logged In

1. Use ngrok for HTTPS: `npx ngrok http 3000`
2. Visit your ngrok URL
3. Login with Facebook
4. You should land on the dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to Facebook Pages

Click **"Facebook Pages"** in the sidebar, or visit:
```
/dashboard/pages
```

### Step 3: Connect Pages

1. **Click "Connect Page" button**
   - Facebook SDK will fetch your pages
   - This calls `/me/accounts` via Facebook Graph API

2. **Select Pages in Dialog**
   - You'll see all pages where you're an admin
   - Check the boxes for pages you want to connect
   - Already connected pages show "Already Connected" badge

3. **Click "Connect X Pages"**
   - Pages get saved to Supabase
   - Success toast appears
   - Pages appear in your list immediately

### Step 4: Verify Pages Connected

You should see:
- ✅ Page cards with avatars
- ✅ Follower counts
- ✅ Category badges
- ✅ "Active" status badge
- ✅ Delete button to disconnect

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch

When you click "Connect Page":

```javascript
[Facebook SDK] Fetching user pages...
[Facebook SDK] Pages response: {data: [{id: "...", name: "..."}]}
[Pages] Fetched 3 pages

// When you click "Connect":
[Pages] Connecting 2 pages...
[Pages API] Connecting 2 pages for user: uuid
[Pages API] Inserted new page: My Business Page
[Pages API] Connected 2 pages successfully, 0 failed
```

## 📊 What Permissions Are Needed

When you logged in with Facebook, you granted these permissions:
- ✅ `pages_show_list` - See your pages
- ✅ `pages_manage_posts` - Post to pages
- ✅ `pages_read_engagement` - Read engagement data
- ✅ `pages_messaging` - Send messages

These permissions allow the app to:
1. Fetch your Facebook pages
2. Get page details and follower counts
3. Get page access tokens
4. Send messages on behalf of your pages

---

## 🎯 After Connecting Pages

Once pages are connected, you can:

### 1. Send Messages
- Go to `/dashboard/compose`
- Select a connected page from dropdown
- Write your message
- Send to all followers or active users

### 2. View Page Stats
- Dashboard shows connected pages count
- Pages page shows total followers
- Each page card shows individual stats

### 3. Manage Pages
- Disconnect pages you don't need
- Reconnect to update access tokens
- View page status (active/inactive)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Pages Appear in Dialog

**Possible Causes:**
1. You don't have any Facebook pages
2. You're not an admin of any pages
3. Facebook permissions were denied

**How to Check:**
- Look in console: `[Facebook SDK] Pages response: {data: []}`
- Empty array means no pages found

**Fix:**
1. Create a Facebook page at [facebook.com/pages/create](https://facebook.com/pages/create)
2. Make sure you're an admin (not just editor)
3. Try connecting again

### Pages Don't Save to Database

**Check Console:**
```javascript
[Pages API] Insert error for page 123: <error message>
```

**Common Errors:**
- **"violates row-level security"** → Need to fix RLS policy
- **"duplicate key"** → Page already connected
- **"foreign key constraint"** → User doesn't exist in database

**Fix:**
See `DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md` for database troubleshooting

### "Facebook SDK not loaded" Error

**Fix:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Wait a few seconds for SDK to load
3. Check console for `[Facebook SDK] Initialized in dashboard`

## 🔒 Security Note

Page access tokens are sensitive! They allow:
- Posting to the page
- Sending messages
- Reading page data

**What we do:**
- ✅ Store tokens in database (not client-side)
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Implement RLS policies
- ✅ Never log tokens to console

---

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Reconnect to Refresh Tokens

If a page's access token expires:
1. Go to Facebook Pages
2. Click "Connect Page"
3. Select the same page again
4. It will update with a fresh token

### Get Page Insights

The access token allows you to fetch:
- Follower demographics
- Post engagement rates
- Best posting times
- Message response rates

(These features can be added later)
