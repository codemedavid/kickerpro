## ⚠️ Quick Safety Checklist

Before deleting a tag, ask yourself:

- [ ] Am I okay with it being removed from **all conversations**?
- [ ] Have I checked how many conversations use it?
- [ ] Can I just **edit** the name/color instead?
- [ ] Is this an old campaign tag I no longer need?

**If all answers are YES → Safe to delete!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Bulk Remove First**
If you want selective removal:
1. Go to Conversations
2. Bulk remove tag from unwanted conversations
3. Then delete the tag
4. Remaining conversations keep it

### **Tip 2: Check Usage Count**
- 0 conversations = Safe to delete
- 1-10 = Low impact
- 10-100 = Medium impact
- 100+ = High impact, review carefully

### **Tip 3: Edit > Delete**
- Renaming? → Use Edit
- Recoloring? → Use Edit
- Removing? → Use Delete

### **Tip 4: Clean Regularly**
- Monthly: Review unused tags
- After campaigns: Remove campaign tags
- Before busy season: Clean up old tags
