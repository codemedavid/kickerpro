As requested, I **removed** the 24-hour indicator feature:

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### Pagination Logic:
```typescript
const ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 20;
const totalPages = Math.ceil(filteredConversations.length / ITEMS_PER_PAGE);
const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * ITEMS_PER_PAGE;
const paginatedConversations = filteredConversations.slice(startIndex, startIndex + 20);
```

### Contact Selection:
```typescript
// Selecting contacts
const toggleContact = (senderId: string) => {
  const newSelection = new Set(selectedContacts);
  newSelection.has(senderId) ? newSelection.delete(senderId) : newSelection.add(senderId);
  setSelectedContacts(newSelection);
};

// Passing to compose page
sessionStorage.setItem('selectedContacts', JSON.stringify({
  contacts: selected,
  pageId: selectedPageId
}));
router.push('/dashboard/compose');
```

### Message Data Structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Campaign Title",
  "content": "Message content",
  "page_id": "uuid",
  "recipient_type": "selected",
  "recipient_count": 15,
  "selected_recipients": ["123", "456", "789"],  // ← New!
  "status": "sent"
}
```
